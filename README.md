# rock-scissors-paper

I designed it to be as intuitive and as fun as possible, with three button side-by-side for both player and computer and an big number to indicate the score. The player's button has hover effects to guide the player to click on it. The result of each 
match and score is announced real time for a more responsive effects for users.I added some css changes at computer's button every match to make it more alive. Each computer button's border color changes to red indicates computer's choice, background color changes to yellow when it wins and to 
black when it loses. Those who get 5 score is the real winner so I added perpetual and colorful animation for a more festive feeling. I learnt from video tutorial to remove the css transition effects by adding an event listener to detect transition end to prepare for next computer's css response.   
The code is basic but I have learnt a ton from this first project I made. It has a lot improvement to be made and I have a lot to learn how to write a better and cleaner code, but it's time to move on to get more exposure on different exciting projects. 

It was a fun journey and I finally made it!
